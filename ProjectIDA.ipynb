    "In the modern world, almost everyone interacts with an art form - music. Music is listened to, created, reproduced and sung. Over the years, listening to music has developed with tremendous success and today one of the most popular music services is the streaming service Spotify, with nearly 300 million users worldwide. The service contains a database of 60 million tracks of all genres. As users themselves say, this service, unlike other platforms, has many advantages, such as: a simple and convenient interface, reasonable rates for access to catalogs of various tracks, a high-quality algorithm for selecting individual playlists, easy registration and payment methods, integration with social networks, cross-platform, streaming of tracks and albums - this function affects the increase in the popularity of an artist all over the world (the more followers and the number of listens to the artist's tracks, the artist is recognizable).Those songs that achieve great success among the audience remain in memory for a long time. Their influence on people can be so great that they leave their contribution to history. Songs can sometimes show us the development of entire generations.So, main goal of the project is to research and see power of the music."
